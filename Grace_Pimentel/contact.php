				<p>My name is Grace Pimentel and I am a Web and Mobile Computing Major at Rochester Institute of Technology.</p>
		
				<p>The reason why I chose to base this project on Manhattan, New York is because my family and I reside just nearby in Brooklyn, New York but
				 my most memorable memories lie in Manhattan, New York. Each time I step into Manhattan, it feels like stepping into a new adventure, where 
				 endless possibilities and captivating experiences await around every corner. This projects helps express my love and allows me to practice 
				 what it takes to make a website.</p>
