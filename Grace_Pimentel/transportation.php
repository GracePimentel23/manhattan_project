		<div class="piccontent">
		<p>Transportation in Manhattan is centralized around taxies, buses,subways and personal cars.
		The majority of people in Manhattan relies on public transportation to get around due to Manhattans large population, 
		driving around in a car will almost always mean getting stuck in traffic. So people tend to push away from driving their own personal cars. Public transportation has become 
		a culture and a lifestyle for Manhattans residents.</p>

		<h2>Taxis</h2>
		<p>Taxis have been a staple iconic symbol for Manhattan's transportation above ground. You may be familiar with hailing a taxi from the curbside or seen a long line of yellow taxis awaiting for someone to get a ride.
		Through out the years, locals and tourist have relied on taxis to navigate the city streets. If you are new to Manhattan and afraid you'll get lost in the subway systems, taxis would be you way around the city.  </p>

		<h2>Public Buses</h2>
		<p>From the Upper West Side to the Lower East Side, public buses connect neighborhoods and provide essential links to key destinations throughout Manhattan.With frequent service and accessible stops, public buses offer
		 a convenient option for those looking to explore the borough at their own pace. Buses are the above ground subways, cheap and quick. But the downside of using a bus would be the traffic. As said before, Car transportation often leads to getting stuck in traffic which would include buses. 
		 The bus isn't as reliable as subways since traffic cannot be predicted deeming buses to be unreliable at time. None the less, buses are still a great way to travel. </p>

		<h2>Subway System </h2>
		<p>Now for the most traditional way for a New Yorker to get transportation, would be the subway system. The subway system is said to take you anywhere throughout the five boroughs. With a network of interconnected lines spanning the length of the borough, 
		the subway offers a fast, efficient, and cost-effective way to traverse Manhattan and beyond. If you were to miss our train, there will be another one already on its way within 3-15 mins.  Trains are usually very time effective and consistent with its arrival times,
		allowing people to have the convenience and accessibility to fast transport without having to have a lot of money.</p>
