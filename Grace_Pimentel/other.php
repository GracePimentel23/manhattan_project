				<h2>Art: Grafiti & Murals</h2>
				<p>Grafiti and Murals are a common occurrence here in Manhattan. They help feel those empty places and walls to bring awareness or member important people
				 who have made an impact in our world. If you end up visiting, the Golden Diner from the food section, you will be able to see a mural 
				  of popular soccer players. This is also a perfect spot to take pictures and brag about where your adventures have taken you! </p>
