		<h2>Golden Diner</h2>
		<p>Golden Diner is located at 123 Madison St, New York, NY 10002. This is one of my favorite dinners in Manhattan since it is a hidden gem!
		The Golden Diner isn't a big restaurant but rather a small coffee shop. They are open daily from 10 am to 10 pm. When you decide to go, get their signature 
		honey butter fluffy pancakes, stuffed breakfast burritos or their fantastic korean fired chicken wings! With their small but warm staff, you will feel right at home.</p>

		<h2>Naruto Ramen</h2>
		<p>Naruto Ramen has 3 main location: 1596 3rd Ave, New York, NY 10128, 2634 Broadway and 276 5th Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11215. Since Manhattan is so big with different kinds of people. There are multiple places for people
		to find a community, whether its culture, passions or hobbies. Naruto Ramen is one of these places! This shop is influenced on a popular TV series replicating meals from the TV show and characters bringing them to life.
		Some dishes I recommend are Ramune(type of soda), Japanese Buns and their Naruto Ramen bowl. If you really want to become one of the characters, you should get their signature MEGA Naruto ramen bowl.</p>
