				<h2>Times Square</h2>
				<div class="piccontent">
    			<p>Welcome to the heart of the city that never sleeps â€“ Times Square. This saying specifically originates from this part of Manhattan due to constant crowds of busy people, 
    			people never stop moving and it will never have a quiet moment. Apart from the people, your eyes will be filled with the same experience! Loud billboards, neon colors, bright 
    			light and big screens everywhere even at night, there will always be light. Times Square is also the home to the famous and businesses with good reputations! From Broadway theaters to world-class restaurants, you will find those here at Times Square!</p>

				<h2>Statue of Liberty</h2>
				<div class="piccontent">
				<p>The Statue of Liberty began as a gift from the people of France to the United States of America to indicate Americas main values of
		liberty, democracy and opportunity for all (as the traditional song goes). The statue of liberty can now be accessible to tourist and anyone who is interested.
		Visitors would be able to explore the small island from a nice ferry ride, go inside the statue and even look at Manhattan from standing from her crown. It would be best to go on a bright 
		clear and early morning so that you can fully experience the view. I recommend going!</p>

				<h2>Bryant Park</h2>
				<div class="piccontent">
				<p>Bryant Park is home to those who want to take a break from the chaos of Time Square or want to reconnect with nature. You will be able to go through a beautiful garden or sit down reading a book on a lawn.
		Its calmness is what attract people here but people are also attracted to the fun activities held here! Bryant Park holds concerts, film screening, cultural festivals and brings seasonal markets through out the year.
		During the warmer seasons, people enjoy the vibrant colors of their gardens and on colder seasons, people come together to try the ice skating rank.</p>
