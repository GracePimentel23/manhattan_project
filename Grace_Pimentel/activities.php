		<h2>AMC Theater</h2>
		<p>If you want to branch off of online streaming services and explore outside of the comfort of your home, come visit
		 the AMC Theater. This theater definitely standout out amongst other theaters due to one major feature: 4DX. The 4DX experience involves
		 motion-seats, wind, simulations, scent, snow and/or water being present in your movie watching experience. These effects 
		 brings out your other senses allowing you to immerse yourself even more when watching a film. I recommend thrillers or action movies to fully experience 
		 these features! It will be a fun experience over all! </p>
